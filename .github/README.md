# Command line tool for nscale

[todo]

## Usage

Nscale has a concept of a namespace. This is your system's ecosystem. Remember, you're not building an application you're building a system of components that work together to do things you need.

With that, lets create a namespace.

`nscale init my-namespace`

This will create a local development enviroment where you can start adding services.
